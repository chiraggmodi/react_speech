# React Speech Recognition

This is an example of a ReactJS web application streaming microphone audio from the browser
to a NodeJS server and transmitting the DeepSpeech results back to the browser.

#### Speak any word:

```
you can speak any word and the DeepSpeech API will deact that word and find the meaning of that word from the Dictionary
```

#### Install:

```
yarn install
```

#### Run ReactJS Client:

```
yarn start
```

#### Run NodeJS Server (in a separate terminal window):

```
node server.js
```
